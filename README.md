# Notes to Grader
<pre>
Hopefully you wont dock me for lack of commits. Did this in 
one go in about 30 minutes while listening to Led Zeppelin and
drinking my 6th cup of coffee for the day. Due to this I didn't 
think to commit as I went along. 

* I hope you have a sense of humor or Im screwed. While in a 
professional setting I would never take such liberites making this 
app so silly but, this will never see the light of day outside of 
you and I. Lord only know how many 'Password Generators' you've
seen today so hopefully this one at least broke the monotony.
